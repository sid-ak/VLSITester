# VLSI-Tester
CIS 4930 (VLSI Testing) - Final Project at USF.  
Implements an automatic test generator for single stuck-at faults in Python.

## Supports:
- [0] Read a circuit description using the specified format.
- [1] Fault collapsing.
- [2] Fault class listing.
- [3] Simulate a fault free for faulty circuit with the given vector.
- [4] Test generation for single stuck at faults using D-Algorithm.

## Getting Started
- Ensure python 3.10 or higher is installed.
- Extract VLSITester-main.zip.
- Run command in the directory source: python main.py
- To test your own circuit, place file with correct format in directory: benchmarks
